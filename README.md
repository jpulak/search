# search
3.Search Benchmark CS1337
Write a program that has an array of at least 20 integers. It should call a function that uses the linear search algorithm to locate one of the values. The function should keep a count of the number of comparisons it makes until it finds the value. The program then should call a function that uses the binary search algorithm to locate the same value. It should also keep count of the number of comparisons it makes. Display these values on the screen.
Here is the sample input.
`int tests[ARRAY_SIZE] = { 101, 142, 147, 189, 199, 207, 222, 234, 289, 296, 310, 319, 388, 394, 417, 429, 447, 521, 536, 600 };`
Output
`Searching for the value 521, located near the end of the array. The linear search made 18 comparisons. The binary search made 3 comparisons.`
